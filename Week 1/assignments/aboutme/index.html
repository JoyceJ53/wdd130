        Hi! My name is Joyce Jensen and I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm a Computer Science major with a minor of computer programming. While my degree is in Computer Science I'm still not sure what kind of job I want in the future (web design, game development, etc.) but I know I want to work with computers and I'm taking this class to explore some of my options.

        I love Baking, painting, playing the ukulele, and programming. My favorite thing about BYU Idaho is the spirit here. It's such an amazing and sweet spirit that you can't find at any other school.

        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life and absolutely love it. I served a mission in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala and it's my first semester back! My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 26:24, and my favorite quote is from President Nelson and says "As you choose to live on the Lord's side, you are never alone."
